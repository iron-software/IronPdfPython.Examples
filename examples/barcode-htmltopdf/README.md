Python developers can integrate barcodes into their PDF documents using IronPDF for Python through two distinct methods, as detailed below:

## Method 1: Incorporating Barcodes with `ChromePdfRenderer`

This method is suited for embedding text-based information into barcodes:

1. Define a string variable to include HTML elements as follows:
   - A `link` element linking to a barcode web font such as [this one](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Barcode+128).
   - An element that contains the text you wish to convert into a barcode.
2. Instantiate a `ChromePdfRenderer` object.
3. Utilize the `RenderHtmlAsPdf` function of the newly created object, passing the string variable as an argument.
4. Save the `PdfDocument` object produced to a disk file.

## Method 2: Implementing Barcodes with `BarcodeStamper`

Opt for this method if you need precise control over the barcode's appearance (e.g., dimensions, positioning on the page):

1. Begin by creating a `PdfDocument` object, demonstrated below:

    ```python
    # Create from an existing PDF file on the file system
    existing_pdf = PdfDocument("existing.pdf")

    # Generate from HTML!
    new_pdf = ChromePdfRenderer().RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Hello world!</h1>")
    ```

2. Construct a `BarcodeStamper` object, detailing the text you wish to encode, and optionally specify the barcode format, width, and height.
3. Utilize the `applyStamp` method on the `PdfDocument` object.
4. Save the modified document.

For additional customization options in generating barcodes, consider using the [IronBarcode C# Library](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/barcode/).
*(These can then be further manipulated within your PDFs using IronPDF for Python's [HtmlStamper](https://ironpdf.com/python/examples/stamping-new-content/)!)*
