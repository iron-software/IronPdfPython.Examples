Python developers have two main options to integrate barcodes into their PDFs using IronPDF for Python, as described below:

## Method 1: Embedding Barcodes with the `ChromePdfRenderer`

This method allows the inclusion of textual information within barcodes:

1. Define a string variable that includes the necessary HTML:
   - A `link` element that points to a barcode font such as [this one](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Barcode+128).
   - An element that contains the text you wish to convert into a barcode.
2. Instantiate a new `ChromePdfRender` object.
3. Execute the `RenderHtmlAsPdf` method on this object, passing in the previously defined string.
4. Save the generated `PdfDocument` object to a file.

## Method 2: Implementing Barcodes with the `BarcodeStamper`

This method offers enhanced customization for barcode properties such as dimensions and placement:

1. Begin by creating a `PdfDocument` object, either from an existing PDF or from HTML, as demonstrated below.

    ```python
    # Load an existing PDF file
    existing_pdf = PdfDocument("existing.pdf")

    # Generate a PDF from HTML
    new_pdf = ChromePdfRenderer().RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Hello world!</h1>")
    ```

2. Initialize a `BarcodeStamper` object, specifying the barcode text and the desired barcode format. You may also set properties like width and height.
3. Use the `applyStamp` method to insert the barcode onto the `PdfDocument`.
4. Write the updated PDF to disk.

For greater flexibility with barcode creation, consider utilizing the [IronBarcode C# Library](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/barcode/).
