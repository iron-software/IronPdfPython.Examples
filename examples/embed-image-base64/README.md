IronPDF for Python offers the capability to transform raw image bytes into PDF files.

Start by retrieving the byte stream from your data source, which might be a database, a network connection, or a file. Convert this data into a string and craft an HTML snippet embedding it as base64 within the `src` attribute for an `img` element:

```txt
<img src="data:image/png;base64,{BINARY+DATA+HERE}">
```

Next, use the `RenderHtmlAsPdf` method by passing your constructed HTML string to it.

The advantage of using IronPDF is its ability to interpret HTML as a formatting language. Simply convert your multimedia content into valid HTML, and IronPDF will handle the conversion process efficiently.
