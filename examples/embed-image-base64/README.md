IronPDF for Python is capable of transforming image byte data directly into PDF files.

Begin by extracting the byte stream from its sourceâ€”this might be a database, network connection, or file. Next, convert this byte stream into a string format. You can then construct an HTML string embedding the image data as a base64-encoded value in the `src` attribute of an `img` tag:

```txt
<img src="data:image/png;base64,{BINARY+DATA+HERE}>
```

Once your HTML string is ready, pass it to the `RenderHtmlAsPdf` method to generate your PDF.

IronPDF excels by utilizing HTML as the foundational design language. Simply convert your media into proper HTML format, and allow IronPDF to handle the conversion process efficiently.
