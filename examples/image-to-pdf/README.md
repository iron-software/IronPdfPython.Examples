The `ImageToPdfConverter` class is designed to generate PDF documents from image files.

Utilize the `ImageToPdfConverter.ImageToPdf` method with a specific image file path to create a PDF document from that particular image.

When you use the `ImageToPdfConverter.ImageToPdf` method with an array of image paths, it will compile a single PDF document where each image is placed on a different page.
