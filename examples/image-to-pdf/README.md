The `ImageToPdfConverter` class is designed to generate PDF documents from images.

To create a PDF document from a single image, use the `ImageToPdfConverter.ImageToPdf` method, providing a correct file path to the image.

If you need to create a PDF document from multiple images, use the `ImageToPdfConverter.ImageToPdf` method with an array of image paths. This will compile all the images into one PDF file, with each image placed on a distinct page.
