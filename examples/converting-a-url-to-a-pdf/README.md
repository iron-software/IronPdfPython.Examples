IronPDF for Python readily transforms online webpages into PDF documents.

In this Java-based example, the `RenderUrlAsPdf` method is utilized. This method produces a `PdfDocument` object, which can be saved through the `saveAs` function.

The `PdfDocument.renderUrlAsPdf` function requires a String parameter that includes a fully qualified URL. IronPDF accesses and retrieves the HTML content from this URL via an HTTP request, subsequently converting it to a PDF. To access URL requiring authentication, developers can provide credentials using the `ChromeHttpLoginCredentials` object as an optional parameter, which is particularly useful for pages under password-protected directories. Comprehensive details on `ChromeHttpLoginCredentials` can be found in the API Reference.

This technique offers a sophisticated solution for downloading PDFs directly from URLs in Java.

Additionally, explore the `ChromePdfRenderOptions` on its [API Reference page](https://ironpdf.com/java/object-reference/api/com/ironsoftware/ironpdf/render/ChromePdfRenderOptions.html) to learn about tweaking the PDFâ€™s appearance during its transition from HTML.
