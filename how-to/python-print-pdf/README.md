## Introduction

The ability to print PDF files in Python represents a crucial skill, enabling developers to efficiently handle documents across different platforms. Given their widespread use for file storage and distribution, PDFs are vital for Python-based applications that manage documents or complex workflows.

Python supports various techniques for creating and printing PDF files, among which employing specific libraries stands out. These libraries offer classes tailor-made for PDF operations. This detailed guide will walk you through using the IronPDF library to create and print PDF documents effortlessly in Python.

## Using IronPDF: A Python PDF Library

IronPDF, inspired by its counterpart for C# .NET available [here](https://ironpdf.com/documentation/csharp-net-pdf-library/), is a formidable Python library designed for PDF manipulation including generation and conversion. This library is particularly useful within the Python environment, providing a rich set of features.

Developers can benefit from IronPDF's high-level API, which simplifies PDF manipulation by abstracting the more complex low-level tasks. It supports various PDF tasks such as creating, adding content, text formatting, and merging or splitting of documents.

A notable functionality of IronPDF is its conversion of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into PDFs, allowing developers to create documents directly from web content or HTML sources easily. Moreover, IronPDF also supports printing PDFs directly, enhancing its functionality and practicality.

## Installation of IronPDF with Pip

To integrate IronPDF into your project, you can use pip for installation. Execute the command below:

```shell
pip install ironpdf
```

Once installed, incorporate IronPDF into your project as follows:

```py
from ironpdf import *
```

## Loading a PDF

IronPDF offers a straightforward constructor for loading PDFs into your project, accepting various inputs like byte arrays or file paths. For password-protected PDFs, you can specify the password as an additional argument.

Example code to load a PDF from your filesystem:

```py
License.LicenseKey = "Enter-Your-License"
pdf = PdfDocument.FromFile("MyPdf.pdf")
```

## Default PDF Printing

IronPDF facilitates two approaches to print a PDF.

The first method utilizes the default printer and settings for immediate printing, as shown:

```py
pdf.Print()
```

## Customizing Print Settings

Alternatively, IronPDF provides the option to customize print settings via the `GetPrintDocument` method, which returns a **PrintDocument** object. This object allows access to **PrinterSettings**, where specific pages can be selected for printing.

```py
printer_setting = pdf.GetPrintDocument()
printer_setting.PrinterSettings.FromPage = 2
printer_setting.PrinterSettings.ToPage = 4
printer_setting.Print()
```

## Comprehensive Source Code

Below is the full source listing as used in this guide:

```py
from ironpdf import *

License.LicenseKey = "Enter-Your-License"
pdf = PdfDocument.FromFile("MyPdf.pdf")

pdf.Print()

printer_setting = pdf.GetPrintDocument()
printer_setting.PrinterSettings.FromPage = 2
printer_setting.PrinterSettings.ToPage = 4
printer_setting.Print()
```

## Conclusion

To conclude, IronPDF offers a powerful and intuitive library for managing PDF printing within Python applications. It provides a plethora of functionalities and extensive documentation, making the creation and customization of high-quality PDFs simple and straightforward. No matter the document type you need, from invoices to reports, IronPDF has the necessary tools.
