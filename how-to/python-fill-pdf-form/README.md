```

With IronPDF installed, you can now enhance your Python scripts with powerful PDF processing capabilities.

## Programmatic PDF Form Filling with Python Code

Explore how to use IronPDF for generating and filling PDF forms with the following Python code example, which leverages HTML templates to create editable forms:

```python
from ironpdf import *

# Define an HTML template with form elements

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/how-to/python-fill-pdf-form/>***

form_html = """
<html>
<body>
<h2>Editable PDF Form</h2>
<form>
First Name: <br> <input type='text' name='firstname' value=''> <br>
Last Name: <br> <input type='text' name='lastname' value=''>
</form>
</body>
</html>
"""

# Configure Renderer

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/how-to/python-fill-pdf-form/>***

renderer = ChromePdfRenderer()
renderer.RenderingOptions.CreatePdfFormsFromHtml = True
renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf(form_html).SaveAs("BasicEditableForm.pdf")

# Access and modify PDF form fields

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/how-to/python-fill-pdf-form/>***

form_pdf = PdfDocument.FromFile("BasicEditableForm.pdf")

# Modify and read the "firstname" input field

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/how-to/python-fill-pdf-form/>***

first_name_field = form_pdf.Form.GetFieldByName("firstname")
first_name_field.Value = "John"
print("First Name Field: {}".format(first_name_field.Value))

# Modify and read the "lastname" input field

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/how-to/python-fill-pdf-form/>***

last_name_field = form_pdf.Form.GetFieldByName("lastname")
last_name_field.Value = "Doe"
print("Last Name Field: {}".format(last_name_field.Value))

form_pdf.SaveAs("CompletedForm.pdf")
```

Initially, we convert an HTML form to a PDF by using the `renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf` method. The **RenderingOptions** setting allows enabling the creation of editable forms from HTML code, which are then stored in a designated file.

Following that, we open the newly created PDF and dynamically populate the form fields using the `GetFieldByName` method to specify the form elements, updating their **Value** properties accordingly. The filled form is then saved to a new file.
