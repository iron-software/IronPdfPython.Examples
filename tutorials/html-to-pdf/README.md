## 2. Converting HTML to PDF

In this portion of our guide, we explore the robust features of IronPDF to transform HTML into PDF format.

At the core of the conversion process is the `ChromePdfRenderer` class, which is instrumental in rendering PDF documents. Additionally, the `PdfDocument` class enriches the library with various document manipulation functionalities. IronPDF offers dependable solutions for converting HTML to PDF, effectively addressing **three main scenarios**:

- Transforming HTML strings or markup into PDFs
- Converting HTML files or zipped content into PDFs
- Transforming URLs into PDF documents

Each scenario is succinctly discussed in this section, along with supplementary materials for further exploration.

### 2.1 Integrating the IronPDF Library

To utilize IronPDF in your project, incorporate these import statements at the start of your Python source files that will make use of the IronPDF functionalities:
```python
# Necessary imports for IronPDF Python usage

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

from ironpdf import *
```

```python
# Importing the necessary modules from IronPDF for Python

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

from ironpdf import *
```

### 2.2. Configure Licensing (Optional)

While IronPDF for Python can be used at no cost, it places a tiled watermark on PDFs generated by free accounts.

<div class="content-img-align-center">
	<div class="center-image-wrapper">
    <iframe loading="lazy" src="/static-assets/ironpdf-python/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-no-license.pdf" width="100%" height="500px">
</iframe>
    <p class="content__image-caption">Visit <a href='/python/licensing/'>licensing page</a> to obtain your license key and enjoy watermark-free PDF.</p>
	</div>
</div>

To create PDF files that are free from watermarks when using IronPDF, a valid license key must be set within the library. Below is a code snippet that illustrates how to apply your license key:

```py
# Setting your license key

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

License.LicenseKey = "IRONPDF-YOUR-LICENSE-KEY-XYZ123"
```

Make sure to place this code to set the license key before executing any PDF creation or manipulation tasks.

```py
# Set the license for using IronPDF without watermark

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

License.LicenseKey = "IRONPDF-MYLICENSE-KEY-1EF01"
```

Make sure to set the license key prior to creating or modifying PDF documents. It's advised to initiate the `License.LicenseKey` method as the first line in your script to ensure proper licensing is applied from the start.

For acquiring a license key, visit our [licensing page](https://ironpdf.com/python/licensing/) or get in touch with us to [request a free trial license key](https://ironpdf.com#trial-license).

### 2.3 Configure the Log File Path (optional)

IronPDF is equipped to produce log messages, which are saved by default in a text file titled **Default.log** located in the same folder as your Python script.

Should you prefer to tailor the logging file's name or its storage location, you can adjust the `LogFilePath` property as demonstrated in the following code snippet:

```py
# Customize the log path

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

Logger.EnableDebugging = True
Logger.LogFilePath = "Custom.log"
Logger.LoggingMode = Logger.LoggingModes.All
```

It's essential to establish the `Logger.LogFilePath` property prior to invoking any PDF conversion or manipulation functionalities within IronPDF.

Here's a paraphrased version of the provided code snippet with enhanced comments, helping to explain the setup for logging configuration in IronPDF:

```py
# Enable debugging to capture detailed log information

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

Logger.EnableDebugging = True

# Specify the name and path of the log file

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

Logger.LogFilePath = "Custom.log"

# Set the logging mode to capture all events

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

Logger.LoggingMode = Logger.LoggingModes.All
```

This code snippet configures IronPDF to generate a comprehensive log file named `Custom.log`, which records all debugging information, assisting developers in troubleshooting and ensuring seamless PDF generation.

Setting the `Logger.LogFilePath` property should precede all PDF conversion and manipulation operations.

### 2.4. Generating PDFs from HTML Strings

The `RenderHtmlAsPdf` functionality allows for HTML strings to be transformed into documents in PDF format.

Hereâ€™s how you can create a PDF from a basic HTML string featuring a header:

```py
from ironpdf import *

# Create a new instance of the renderer

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

renderer = ChromePdfRenderer()

# Convert HTML string to PDF

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

pdf = renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Welcome to IronPDF!</h1>")

# Save the PDF to a file

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

pdf.SaveAs("your_pdf_output.pdf")
```

Here's the paraphrased section:

```py
from ironpdf import ChromePdfRenderer

# Creating a new instance of the PDF renderer

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

renderer = ChromePdfRenderer()

# Generating a PDF document from a specified HTML string

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

pdf_document = renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Welcome to IronPDF!</h1>")

# Saving the generated PDF to a file

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

pdf_document.SaveAs("generated-output.pdf")
```

This revised code block is functionally equivalent to the original, with changes made to variable naming and comments to enhance clarity and vary the phrasing.

<div class="content-img-align-center">
	<div class="center-image-wrapper">
		<a rel="nofollow" href="/static-assets/ironpdf-java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-5.webp" target="_blank"><img src="/static-assets/ironpdf-java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-5.webp" alt="" class="img-responsive add-shadow"></a>
    <p class="content__image-caption">Convert HTML markup into PDF File using the <code>RenderHtmlAsPdf</code> method. This method can generate PDFs using all valid W3C-compliant HTML and CSS markup.</p>
	</div>
</div>

The method `RenderHtmlAsPdf` effectively interprets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, mimicking the capabilities of contemporary browsers to provide a precise depiction of the content. This capability allows software developers to generate PDF documents that are visually consistent with their web representations.

Additionally, `RenderHtmlAsPdf` is adept at incorporating external resources like images, stylesheets, and scripts, whether they are stored locally or on a network. Below is an example illustrating how to generate a PDF from HTML content that includes references to a CSS file and an image located within an **assets** directory:

Here's the paraphrased section of the article, with updated and resolved URLs for image paths:

```py
from ironpdf import *

# Prepare the HTML content with external CSS and image link

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

html_content = """
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Welcome Message</title>
      <link rel='stylesheet' href='assets/style.css'>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>Greetings from IronPDF!</h1>
      <a href='https://ironpdf.com/python/'><img src='https://ironpdf.com/assets/logo.png' /></a>
   </body>
</html>
"""

# Create an instance of the ChromePdfRenderer class

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

renderer_instance = ChromePdfRenderer()

# Generate a PDF by rendering the HTML content

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

generated_pdf = renderer_instance.RenderHtmlAsPdf(html_content)

# Save the generated PDF to a file

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

generated_pdf.SaveAs("output_file.pdf")
```

This code initializes the `IronPDF` library, sets up HTML content including an external CSS file and an image, utilizes the `ChromePdfRenderer` to produce a PDF from the HTML, and finally saves it to a file called `"output_file.pdf"`. It now includes absolute paths for resources to ensure clarity.

The output from executing the above code snippet is displayed in the image that follows.

<div class="content-img-align-center">
	<div class="center-image-wrapper">
		<a rel="nofollow" href="/static-assets/ironpdf-python/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-html-string-to-pdf.webp" target="_blank"><img src="/static-assets/ironpdf-python/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-html-string-to-pdf.webp" alt="" class="img-responsive add-shadow"></a>
    <p class="content__image-caption"><code>RenderHtmlAsPdf</code> method is capable of rendering various types of HTML content. If it can be displayed in Chrome, then <code>RenderHtmlAsPdf</code> will render it!</p>
	</div>
</div>

Moreover, developers can enhance the functionality of the `RenderHtmlAsPdf` method by supplying an optional second argument. This argument is used to define a base path for web assets, which can be either a local directory or a URL, depending on where the resources are hosted.

For a more comprehensive exploration of how to deploy the `RenderHtmlAsPdf` method effectively, consider examining [this practical example](https://ironpdf.com/python/examples/using-html-to-create-a-pdf/) or delve into the detailed information available on the API Reference pages.

### 2.5. Generating a PDF from a Webpage

IronPDF enables the transformation of webpages into PDF files using the `RenderUrlAsPdf` method.

Below is an illustrative example of converting content from a Wikipedia page to a PDF document.

Here's the paraphrased section with updated markdown and resolved paths:

```py
from ironpdf import *

# Initialize the PDF Renderer

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

pdf_renderer = ChromePdfRenderer()

# Convert a webpage to a PDF document

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

pdf_document = pdf_renderer.RenderUrlAsPdf("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF")

# Save the generated PDF to a file

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

pdf_document.SaveAs("url.pdf")
```

The displayed PDF format is illustrated below.

<div class="content-img-align-center">
	<div class="center-image-wrapper">
		<a rel="nofollow" href="/static-assets/ironpdf-java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-7.webp" target="_blank"><img src="/static-assets/ironpdf-java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-7.webp" alt="" class="img-responsive add-shadow"></a>
	</div>
</div>

### 2.6. Converting an HTML File to PDF

IronPDF enables the transformation of HTML files into PDF documents, which are stored directly on your local system. It seamlessly renders HTML content into a corresponding PDF format.

For an illustrative example of this feature, the code snippet below demonstrates the process of converting an HTML invoice. Access the HTML source of the [invoice here](https://codepen.io/tjoen/pen/wvgvLX).

Below is the HTML markup for your reference:

```html

```

Here's the revised section:

---
Suppose there's an HTML file, as well as corresponding CSS and JavaScript files, stored in a folder titled "invoices". IronPDF enables the conversion of this HTML document into a PDF format using Python. See the example below for the implementation:

```py
# Initialize the PDF renderer

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

renderer = ChromePdfRenderer()

# Convert HTML file to PDF

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

pdf = renderer.RenderHtmlFileAsPdf("invoices/TestInvoice1.html")

# Save the generated PDF

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

pdf.SaveAs("htmlfile_to_pdf.pdf")
```

This process allows IronPDF to directly interpret the HTML and its related assets, ensuring that styles and scripts are properly incorporated into the final PDF. This ensures a consistent visual representation between the original web page and the converted PDF.

Here is the paraphrased section of the article with resolved relative URL paths:

```py
# Initialize the PDF renderer

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

renderer = ChromePdfRenderer()

# Convert local HTML file to PDF

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

pdf = renderer.RenderHtmlFileAsPdf("invoices/TestInvoice1.html")

# Save the PDF to a file or output it to a stream

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/>***

pdf.SaveAs("htmlfile_to_pdf.pdf")
```

Just as IronPDF effectively handles the conversion of HTML strings to PDF documents, the software also seamlessly resolves relative URLs in HTML files. This guarantees that any included stylesheets and scripts are accurately applied in the PDF output. Consequently, the PDF accurately reflects the original web page's visual aesthetic.
